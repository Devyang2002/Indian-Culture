                food,dress and ethnicity.
                Marathi Hindus revere many religious figures. Among the figures who originated in the region are Banka

                the coastal region of Maharashtra has its own type of cuisine which is a combination of dishes

                eggs, as well as South Indian items such as idli and dosa are also popular. Tea or coffee is served with
