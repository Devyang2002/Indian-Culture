            <br>
            <p>Bihar has a rich cultural heritage. The predominant themes are from the myths and legends of Hinduism.
                The Hindu deities, Lord Rama and His consort, Seeta, and Lord Shiva and His consort, Parvati, form the
                main theme of folk paintings. Bihar, a land of many Buddhist Monasteries is also known as 'The Land of
                Buddha'.
                The beautiful stories of the ancient times are depicted in the exquisite handicrafts of Bihar.
                One of the art forms of Bihar, the Madhubani School of Painting, has lately received much attention and
                poularity.

            <p>Bihar has produced a number of writers of Hindi, including Raja Radhika Raman Singh, Shiva Pujan Sahay,
                Divakar Prasad Vidyarthy, Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar', Ram Briksh Benipuri, Phanishwar Nath 'Renu', Gopal
                Singh "Nepali" and Baba Nagarjun. Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan, the great writer and Buddhist scholar,
                was born in U.P. but spent his life in the land of Lord Buddha, i.e., Bihar. Hrishikesh Sulabh and
                Neeraj Singh (from Ara) are the prominent writer of the new generation. They are short story writer,
                playwright and theatre critic. Arun Kamal and Aalok Dhanwa are the well-known poets. Different regional
                languages also have produced some prominent poets and authors. Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, who is
                among the greatest writers in Bengali, resided for some time in Bihar. Upamanyu Chatterjee also hails
                from Patna in Bihar. Devaki Nandan Khatri, who rose to fame at the beginning of the 20th century on
                account of his novels such as Chandrakanta and Chandrakanta Santati, was born in Muzaffarpur, Bihar.
                Bhikhari Thakur is known as the Shakespeare of Bhojpuri. Heera Dom, a Bhojpuri poet has contributed to
                Dalit literature. Vidyapati is the most renowned poet of Maithili (c. 14–15th century). Satyapal
                Chandra[1] has written many English best-seller novels and he is one of India's emerging young writer.

                Despite of the large number of speakers of Bihari languages, they have not been constitutionally
                recognised in India, except Maithili which is recognised under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution
                of India. Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters in Bihar.These languages
                was legally absorbed under the subordinate label of Hindi in the 1961 Census. Such state and national
                politics are creating conditions for language endangerment. The first success for spreading Hindi
                occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced Urdu as the sole official language of the province. In
                this struggle between competing Hindi and Urdu, the potential claims of the three large mother tongues
                in the region – Bhojpuri, Maithili and Magahi were ignored. After independence Hindi was again given the
                sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950. Urdu became the second official
                language in the undivided State of Bihar on 16 August 1989. Bihar also produced several eminent Urdu
                writers including Sulaiman Nadvi, Manazir Ahsan Gilani, Abdul Qavi Desnavi, Paigham Afaqui, Jabir
                Husain, Sohail Azimabadi, Hussain Ul Haque, Dr. Shamim Hashimi,Wahab Ashrafi etc.

            &#8226 The Mahabodhi Temple (literally: "Great Awakening Temple") or the Mahabodhi Mahavihar, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site, is an ancient, but much rebuilt and restored, Buddhist temple in Bodh Gaya, marking the
            location where the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment
            &#8226 Takht Sri Patna Sahib also known as Takhat Sri Harimandir Ji, is a Gurdwara in the neighbourhood of
            Patna Sahib, India. It was to commemorate the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of the Sikhs
            on December 1666.
            &#8226 The Pathar Ki Mosque stands on the bank of river Ganges near the Takht Shri Harmandir Saheb.
            Parviz Mirza, son of Jahangir, established Pathar Ki Masjid in 1621. The structure is built of stone, and
            so it got its name as Pathar Ki Masjid.
            &#8226 Chaumukhi Mahadev, or Chaturmukhi Mahadev, is a historic Hindu temple located approximately 2
            kilometres (1.2 mi) east of Vaishali Gadh, Bihar, India. The temple has Shivling with four god faces,
            Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh and Surya. While the construction time is unknown, it is believed to have been built
            during the fifth century.
            &#8226 Various legends explain how the Shakti Peetha came into existence. The most popular is based on the
            story of the death of the goddess Sati. Out of grief and sorrow, Shiva carried Sati's body, reminiscing
            about their moments as a couple, and roamed around the universe with it.
