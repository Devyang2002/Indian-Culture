            <br>
            <p>Chhattisgarh is rich in its cultural heritage. The State has a very unique and vibrant culture. There are
                over 35 big and small colourful tribes spread over the region. Their rhythmic folk music, dances and
                dramas are a treat to watch and also provide an insight into the culture of the State. The most famous
                dance-drama of the State is Pandwani, which is a musical narration of the great Hindu epic Mahabharata.
                Raut Nacha ( folk dance of cowherds), the Panthi and Soowa are some of the other famous dance styles of
                the region.

            <p>Chhattisgarh boasts of a rich cultural heritage amidst crusty cuisine, vivacious dances, great religions,
                melodious music, lively people, amiable languages, sparkling fairs & festivals, and marvelous arts &
                crafts. Its unique approach towards dance, cuisine, and music, make it different from others. Perhaps
                all this and the relevant profile have made Chhattisgarh - the preferred choice of anthropologists and
                sociologists. To be honest, the eastern parts of Chhattisgarh are influenced by the Oriya culture.
                Chhattisgarh is a reservoir of talent. Since ages, dance and performing arts have been practiced here.
                Where Raut Nacha is the folk dance of cowherds, Panthi â€˜Karma' and Soowa dance forms are popular all
                over the state. Local dances and dramas, for example, Pandavani, Panthi Dance, Nacha, Gond, and Muria
                are performed at the state fairs and festivals. Pandavani is an ancient style of story telling; actually
                it's a musical narration of the epic - Mahabharata.The arts & crafts of Chhattisgarh truly represent the
                dexterity of its artisans. Amazing wood carvings, bamboo work/furniture, bell metal handicraft, figures
                of terracotta, tribal jewelry, paintings, and clay pieces are some of the specialties from the state.
                The authentic handicrafts, like any other element of culture, are really mesmerizing. If truth be told,
                Chhattisgarh is a place to behold the ancient as well as refined form of arts & crafts.Chhattisgarhi is
                the local dialect of Hindi language in Chhattisgarh. It is spoken Aryan dialect, though it has
                considerable vocabulary and linguistic features of Munda and Dravidian languages. Besides Chhattisgarhi,
                about 93 dialects or languages are spoken in the state. Each of these dialects uses the Devanagari
                script of Hindi regardless of their language group. Hindi, Oriya and Marathi are also commonly used in
                Chhattisgarh.The majority of the state's population belongs to tribal communities, like Gonds, Kanwar,
                Brinjhwar, Bhaina, Bhatra, Oraon, Munda, Kamar, Halba, Baiga, Sanwra, Kowa, Bharia, Nageshia, Manghwar,
                Kharia, and Dhanwar. These people love to ornament themselves with items, such as, cowries, beads,
                shells, bones, feathers, etc. Apart from the tribal, many people of Chhattisgarh actually belong to the
                neighboring states.Due to the influence of early missionaries, many of the tribes converted into
                Christians. The other religious sects, such as, Satnami, Kabirpanth, Ramnami Samaj, etc, that have
                emerged from caste-based Hinduism, also fourish in Chhattisgarh.
