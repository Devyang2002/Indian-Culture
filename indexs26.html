            <br>
            <p> The Culture of Uttar Pradesh is an Indian culture which has its roots in Hindi and Urdu literature,
                music, fine arts, drama and cinema. Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, has historical monuments
                including Bara Imambara and Chhota Imambara, and has preserved the damaged complex of the Oudh-period
                British Resident's quarters, which are being restored.

            <p>Thousands gather at Allahabad (Prayagraj) to take part in the annual Magh Mela festival on the banks of
                the Ganges which is organised on a larger scale every 12th year, when it is called the Kumbha Mela,
                where over 10 million Hindu pilgrims congregate â€“ one of the largest gathering of human beings in the
                world. Badaun is a religiously significant city whose historical monuments and tombs attract thousand of
                tourists annually.

                The historical towns of Sarnath and Kushinagar are not far from Varanasi. Gautama Buddha gave his first
                sermon at Sarnath and died at Kushinagar; both are important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists. Also at
                Sarnath are the Pillars of Ashoka and the Lion Capital of Ashoka, archaeological artefacts with national
                significance.[further explanation needed] Ghazipur, 80 km from Varanasi, has Ganges Ghats and the Tomb
                of British potentate Lord Cornwallis, maintained by the Archaeologic survey of India.
                Kathak is a classical dance form from Uttar Pradesh. Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, was a
                patron and champion of Kathak. Today, the state is home to two prominent schools of this dance form,
                Lucknow Gharana and Banaras Gharana.

                Music personalities including Naushad Ali, Talat Mehmood, Begum Akhtar hihi , Anup Jalota, Shubha
                Mudgal, Bismillah Khan, Ravi Shankar, Kishan Maharaj, Vikash Maharaj, Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Gopal
                Shankar Misra, Siddheshwari Devi, Girija Devi and Sir Cliff Richard were originally from Uttar Pradesh.

                The region's folk heritage includes songs called rasiya (especially popular in Braj), which celebrate
                the mythological love of Radha and Krishna. These songs are accompanied by large drums known as bumb and
                are performed at many festivals. Other folk dances or folk theater forms include Raslila, Swang, Ramlila
                (a dramatic enactment of the entire Ramayana), Nautanki, Naqal (mimicry) and Qawwali.
                The common state-language of Uttar Pradesh is standard Hindi. While standard Hindi (Khari boli) is the
                official language, several regional Hindi 'dialects' are spoken in the state including: Awadhi,
                Bhojpuri, Braj, Kannauji, Bagheli and Bundeli, as well as several local dialects that do not have a
                formal name. Urdu is prominent in Uttar Pradesh as Lucknow was once the centre of Indo-Persianate
                culture in north India. The language of Lucknow ("Lakhnavi Urdu") is a form of high literary Urdu.
