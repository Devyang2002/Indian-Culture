            <p>The Mizo people are an ethnic group native to north-eastern India, western Burma
                and eastern Bangladesh; this term covers several ethnic peoples who speak various Kuki-Chin
                languages. Though the term Mizo is often used to name an overall ethnicity, it is an umbrella term to
                denote the various clans, such as the Hmar, Ralte, Lai, Lusei etc. A number of dialects are still spoken
                under the umbrella of Mizoram.
                Mizoram is the official language of Mizoram, along with English. Mizo language, or Mizo á¹­awng, is a
                language belonging to the Sino-Tibetan family of languages, spoken natively by the Mizo people in
                Mizoram states of India and Chin State in Burma.
                Mizoram people have a number of dances which are accompanied with few musical instrument like the gong
                and drum. The different dances of Mizoram are Cheraw dance, Khuallam, Chheihlam, Chailam, Tlanglam,
                Sarlamkai and Chawnglaizawn.
                Mizoram shares characteristics to other regions of Northeast India and North India. The staple food of
                most of the Mizo people is rice, with meat and vegetables served on the side, ranging from the homely
                bai, a simple vegetable stew, non veg stew with sesame, garlic, onion and herbs.
                Known for its evergreen hills and dense bamboo jungles, Mizoram lies in the southern most tip of north
                east India. Called the Land of Blue Mountains, the hills are crisscrossed by gushing rivers and high
                sparkling waterfalls. The Siaha river is the biggest river in Mizoram and an anglers paradise.
                There are three famous festivals celebrated in Mizoram: Chapchar Kut, Pawl Kut and Mim Kut. All three of
                these Mizoram festivals revolve around agriculture and celebrate the arrival of spring with feasts and
                beautiful traditional dance performances.
