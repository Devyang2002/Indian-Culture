                    <h1>Culture of India</h1>
                    <i>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief
                        systems,
                        political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the
                        ethno-linguistically diverse Indian subcontinent. The term also applies beyond India to
                        countries
                        and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonization, or
                        influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance,
                        music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country.

                        Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a
                        history that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and other
                        early
                        cultural areas. Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics,
                        philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have had a profound impact across the
                        Indosphere, Greater India and the world. Specifically Southeast Asian and Himalayan influence on
                        early India, had lasting impacts on the formation of Hinduism and Indian mythology. Hinduism
                        itself
                        formed from various distinct folk religions, which merged during the Vedic period and following
                        periods. Especially Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer, but also Tibetic
                        and
                        other Tibeto-Burmese groups, left noteworthy influence on local Indian peoples and culture.
                        Several
                        scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and Lévi, among others, concluded that there
                        is
                        a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) influence on early
                        India, which can also be observed by Austroasiatic loanwords within Indo-Aryan languages and
                        rice
                        cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian rice-agriculturalists using a route
                        from
                        Southeast Asia through Northeast India into the Indian subcontinent.India is considered the
                        birthplace of some of the world's major religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism.
                        Today, other religions such as Muslim and Christianity have worked their way into the population
                        as well, though Hinduism remains the most popular.</i>

                <h1>Religious Culture</h1>
                <i>Indian-origin religions Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are all based on the concepts of
                    dharma and karma. Ahimsa, the philosophy of nonviolence, is an important aspect of native Indian
                    faiths whose most well known proponent was Mahatma Gandhi, who used civil disobedience to unite
                    India during the Indian independence movement – this philosophy further inspired Martin Luther King
                    Jr. during the American civil rights movement. Foreign-origin religion, including Abrahamic
                    religions, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam, are also present in India, as well as
                    Zoroastrianism and Baháʼí Faith[10][11] both escaping persecution by Islam have
                    also found shelter in India over the centuries.
                    India has 28 states and 8 union territories with different culture and it is the second most
                    populated country in the world. The Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several
                    various cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a
                    history that is several thousand years old.Throughout the history of India, Indian culture
                    has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions. Influence from East/Southeast Asian cultures
                    onto ancient India and early Hinduism, specifically Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and
                    Mon Khmer, but also Tibetic and other Tibeto-Burmese groups, had noteworthy impact on local Indian
                    peoples and cultures. Several scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and Lévi, among
                    others, concluded that there is a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer
                    (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, which can also be observed by Austroasiatic loanwords
                    within Indo-Aryan languages and rice cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian
                    rice-agriculturalists using a route from Southeast Asia through Northeast India into the Indian
                    subcontinent.They have been credited with shaping much of Indian philosophy, literature,
                    architecture, art and music.Greater India was the historical extent of Indian culture beyond
                    the Indian subcontinent. This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, architecture,
                    administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the
                    travelers and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era.[20][21] To the west,
                    Greater India overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains.[22] Over the
                    centuries, there has been a significant fusion of cultures between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims,
                    Jains, Sikhs and various tribal populations in India.

                    India is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and other religions. They are
                    collectively known as Indian religions. Indian religions are a major form of world religions
                    along with Abrahamic ones. Today, Hinduism and Buddhism are the world's third and fourth-largest
                    religions respectively, with over 2 billion followers altogether,and possibly as many
                    as 2.5 or 2.6 billion followers.Followers of Indian religions – Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and
                    Buddhists make up around 80–82% population of India.

                    India is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of the
                    most deeply religious societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role in the
                    life of many of its people. Although India is a secular Hindu-majority country, it has a large
                    Muslim population. Except for Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram and
                    Lakshadweep, Hindus form the predominant population in all 27 states and 9 union territories.
                    Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra,
                    Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam; while only Jammu and Kashmir and
                    Lakshadweep have majority Muslim populations. Sikhs and Christians are other significant minorities
                    of India.</i>

                    <i>India is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of
                        the most deeply religious societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role
                        in the life of many of its people. Although India is a secular Hindu-majority country, it has a

                        Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,

                        significant minorities of India.

                        Because of the diversity of religious groups in India, there has been a history of turmoil and
                        violence between them. India has been a theatre for violent religious clashes between members of
                        different religions such as Hindus, Christians, Muslims, and Sikhs.[30] Several groups have
                        founded various national-religious political parties, and in spite of government policies
                        minority religious groups are being subjected to prejudice from more dominant groups in order to
                        maintain and control resources in particular regions of India.[30]

                        According to the 2011 census, 79.8% of the population of India practice Hinduism. Islam (14.2%),
                        Christianity (2.3%), Sikhism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%) and Jainism (0.4%) are the other major
                        religions followed by the people of India.[31] Many tribal religions, such as Sarnaism, are
                        found in India, though these have been affected by major religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism,
                        Islam and Christianity.[32] Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and the Baháʼí Faith are also
                        influential but their numbers are smaller.[32] Atheism and agnostics also have visible influence
                        in India, along with a self-ascribed tolerance to other faiths.[32] According to a study
                        conducted by the Pew Research Centre, India will have world's largest populations of Hindus and
                        Muslims by 2050. India is expected to have about 311 million Muslims making up around 19–20% of
                        the population and yet about 1.3 billion Hindus are projected to live in India comprising around
                        76% of the population.

                        Atheism and agnosticism have a long history in India and flourished within Śramaṇa movement. The
                        Cārvāka school originated in India around the 6th century BCE.[33][34] It is one of the earliest
                        form of materialistic and atheistic movement in ancient India.[35][36] Sramana, Buddhism,
                        Jainism, Ājīvika and some schools of Hinduism consider atheism to be valid and reject the
                        concept of creator deity, ritualism and superstitions.[37][38][39] India has produced some
                        notable atheist politicians and social reformers.[40] According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global
                        Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were not religious, 3%
                        were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond</i>
