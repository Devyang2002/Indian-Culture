            <br>
            <p>The culture of Goa is an amalgamation of Indian and Portuguese culture. The long Portuguese rule has
                influenced the culture in more ways than one and many of the Portuguese traditions are reflected in the
                Goan culture even today.

            <p>The crafts and arts of Goa also reflect Hindu, Muslim and Christian origins. Handicrafts are mainly made
                of materials easily available here like- clay, seashells, paper, bamboo, brass, wood, jute, stone and
                coconut shells amongst others. With the heavy inflow of tourists the handicrafts industry has also
                witnessed a boom. The Government of Goa has taken additional steps to further the handicrafts industry
                in Goa and has set up the Goa Handicrafts Rural and Small Scale Industries Development Corporation
                (GHRSSIDC) that has provided employment to many craftsmen.The crafts and arts of Goa also reflect Hindu,

                craftsmen.Dance and music is deeply embedded in the Goan culture. The most popular dance forms in Goa
                are Fugdi and Dhalo, which are traditional dances, performed only by women. Some dances are specific to
                an occasion or festival they are performed in. The Dhangar is performed during the Hindu festival of
                Navaratras and during the Shigmo festival women perform a lamp dance. Goa comes alive in the festive.
                The traditions and customs of Goa have allowed secularism to flourish and have made people more tolerant
                towards other religious practices. It is not uncommon to see people from another religion going to a
                church or a temple or a mosque. They follow the tradition of their choice and at the same time respect
                other customs. This is what makes Goans stand out in a striking contrast to the rest of India. The Goan
                tradition and customs have truly given a unique identity to the state and made it a role model for
                others to follow.
