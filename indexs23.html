        <div class="tamil1">
            <p>Tamil culture is the culture of the Tamil people. Tamil culture is rooted in the arts and ways of life of
                Tamils in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, and across the globe. Tamil culture is expressed in
                language, literature, music, dance, theatre, folk arts, martial arts, painting, sculpture, architecture,
                sports, media, comedy, cuisine, costumes, celebrations, philosophy, religions, traditions, rituals,
                organizations, science, and technology.
                The ancient Tamil grammatical work of the Tolkappiyam and the Sangam works of the Ten Idylls
                (Pattuppāṭṭu) and the Eight Anthologies (Eṭṭuttokai) shed light on early religion of ancient Dravidian
                people. Murugan was glorified as, the god of war, who is ever young and resplendent, as the favored god
                of the Tamils. Sivan was also seen as the supreme God. Early iconography of Murugan and
                Sivan and their association with native flora and fauna goes back to Indus Valley
                Civilization. The Sangam landscape was classified into five categories, thinais, based on the
                mood, the season and the land. Tolkappiyam, mentions that each of these thinai had an associated deity
                such Seyyon in Kurinji-the hills, Thirumaal in Mullai-the forests, and Venthan in Marutham-the plains,
                Kotravai in Palai-the desert and Wanji-ko/kadalon in the Neithal-the coasts and the seas. Other gods
                mentioned were Mayyon and Vaali who were all assimilated into Hinduism over time. Dravidian influence on
                early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known
                Indo-Aryan language, the language of the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words
                borrowed from Dravidian. This represents an early religious and cultural fusion[note 1] or
                synthesis between ancient Dravidians and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with
                sacred iconography, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.
                The Saivist sect of Hinduism is significantly represented amongst Tamils, more so among Sri Lankan
                Tamils, although most of the Saivist places of religious significance are in northern India. The Alvars
                and Nayanars, who were predominantly Tamils, played a key role in the renaissance of Bhakti tradition in
                India. In the 10th century, the philosopher Ramanuja, who propagated the theory of Visishtadvaitam,
                brought many changes to worshiping practices, creating new regulations on temple worship, and accepted
                lower-caste Hindus as his prime disciples.
